## How It Works

Leagues Spider (`leagues_spider.py`):
This spider crawls Transfermarkt to extract league details, such as the country name, league name, and additional data (e.g., club number, player number, total value).
The data is stored in `leagues.json`.

Teams Spider (`teams_spider.py`):
Reads the output.json file generated by the leagues_spider and extracts detailed information on teams from each league.
The extracted data is then stored in a structured format in `teams.json`.

Team Details Spider (`team_details.py`):
This spider crawls individual team pages to extract specific details about the team and its players.
Information such as player stats, team performance, and other relevant data are scraped.
